# Gapminder

Gapminder identifies systematic misconceptions about important global trends and proportions and uses reliable data to develop easy to understand teaching materials to rid people of their misconceptions. The dataset is retreived from [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/data/) 

In this Dataset, we analyze some trends in countries and answer some hypothetical Questions as below.

# Hypothetical Questions

- How are the countries doing economically?
- What factors affect the country development? what discriminates between 1st and 3rd world countries?
- Economic growth reflects how the country is doing in terms of short-term developing
- Number of internet users and personal computers may reflect how the country is doing in terms of long-term developing.

In another form: Does the following factors have any correlation with the country development; short-term and long-term?
- Number of patents
- Agriculture percent of GDP
- Industry percent of GDP
- Total health spending percent of GDP
- Government health spending percent of total gov spending

# Conclusion

- Number of patents does not significantly affect the country development (long-term and short-term), perhaps it might be a reflection of good educational system. Yet in this case, the relationship between the educational system and the number of patents needs to be studied.
- Agricultural percentage of GDP is significantly affecting the country development (long-term and short-term). The more the agricultural industry is eating from the GDP, the less the GDP per captia is. As a rule of sum, less than 30% of the agricultural share is a good standing point.
- Industial percentage of GDP is significanlty affecting the country short-term development; however, it is not significantly affecting the long-term development. The more the country is industrial, the more it is stronger in the GDP.
- Total health spending percent of GDP is significantly affecting the country development (long-term and short-term).
